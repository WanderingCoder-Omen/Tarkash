            <p>Tarkash allows you to capture easily internet communications from a smartphone or any device which can be associated to a Wi-Fi access point in order to quickly analyze and save them. 
            This can be used to verify if there is any suspect or malicious communication from a smartphone, by using Artificial Intelligence, heuristics or specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).</p>

            <p>This backend allows you to manage the configuration of your Tarkash instance. You can push some IOCs for detection and whitelist elements which can be seen during legitimate communications in order to prevent false positives.</p>
